# Ofelia Configuration File
#
# ⚠️  IMPORTANT: This file is NOT currently used!
# The cluster is configured to use Docker labels instead (see docker-compose.yml).
#
# To use this configuration file instead of labels:
# 1. Modify the Ofelia service in docker-compose.yml:
#    - Change: command: daemon --docker
#    - To:     command: daemon --config
#    - Add volume: - ./config/ofelia.ini:/etc/ofelia/config.ini:ro
# 2. Restart Ofelia: docker-compose restart ofelia
#
# See README.md "Backup Configuration" section for full instructions.
